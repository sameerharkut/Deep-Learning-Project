# Face Mask Detection with Deep Learning
This repository contains the code for a deep learning project aimed at detecting whether individuals are wearing face masks or not using various convolutional neural network (CNN) architectures. The models used for this project include DenseNet121, InceptionV3, and MobileNet.

## Dataset
In recent trend in world wide Lockdowns due to COVID19 outbreak, as Face Mask is became mandatory for everyone while roaming outside, approach of Deep Learning for Detecting Faces With and Without mask were a good trendy practice. Here I have created a model that detects face mask trained on 7553 images with 3 color channels (RGB).
Data set consists of 7553 RGB images in 2 folders as with_mask and without_mask. Images are named as label with_mask and without_mask. Images of faces with mask are 3725 and images of faces without mask are 3828.
